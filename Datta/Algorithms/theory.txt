ðŸš€ What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem or perform a task.
ðŸ‘‰ Think of it as a recipe: input ingredients â†’ follow steps â†’ get output.

Example:

Input: A list of numbers [5, 2, 8, 1]

Algorithm: Sort them in ascending order

Output: [1, 2, 5, 8]

ðŸ”‘ Categories of Algorithms
1. Basic Algorithms

Sorting: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort

Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search

2. Divide & Conquer

Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search, Strassenâ€™s Matrix Multiplication

3. Greedy Algorithms

4. Dynamic Programming (DP)

Fibonacci (optimized), Longest Common Subsequence, Knapsack Problem, Matrix Chain Multiplication

5. Graph Algorithms

BFS (Breadth-First Search)

DFS (Depth-First Search)

Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

Bellman-Ford

Floyd-Warshall

Kruskalâ€™s & Primâ€™s

6. Backtracking

N-Queens Problem

Sudoku Solver

Rat in a Maze

7. Advanced Algorithms

KMP Algorithm (String Matching)

ðŸ›  Example: Binary Search (Classic Algorithm)
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return -1

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
print(binary_search(numbers, 7))  # Output: 3
